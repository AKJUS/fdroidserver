Summary:Info on local apps
Description:
Checkey is a utility for getting information about the APKs that are installed
on your device. Starting with a list of all of the apps that you have
installed on your device, it will show you the APK signature with a single
touch, and provides links to virustotal.com and androidobservatory.org to
easily access the profiles of that APK. It will also let you export the
signing certificate and generate ApkSignaturePin pin files for use with the
TrustedIntents library.
