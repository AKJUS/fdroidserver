=Basic instructions=

1. Copy config.sample.py to config.py and edit the path within accordingly
   to point to the Android tools
2. Make a repo directory and put APK files in it
3. Run update.py
4. If it reports that any metadata files are missing, you can create them
   in the metadata directory and run it again.
5. To ease creation of metadata files, run update.py with the -c option. It
   will create 'skeleton' metadata files that are missing, and you can then
   just edit them and fill in the details.
6. Then, if you've changed things, run update.py again.
7. Running update.py adds an Icons directory into the repo directory, and
   also creates the repository index (index.xml).
8. Transfer the repo directory to the appropriate http server. The script
   in upload.sh is an example of how to do this.

=MetaData=

Information used by update.py to compile the public index comes from two
sources, 1) the APK files in the repo directory, and 2) the metadata files
in the metadata directory.

The metadata files are simple, easy to edit text files, always named as the
application's package ID with '.txt' appended. Within the file, the following
fields are recognised:

==License==

The license for the application.

Common values: GPLv2, GPLv2+, GPLv3, Apache2, MIT, BSD

==Name==

The name of the application. Normally, this field should not be present since the
application's correct name is retrieved from the APK file. However, in a situation
where an APK contains a bad or missing application name, it can be overridden
using this.

==Web Site==

The URL for the application's web site.

==Source Code==

The URL to view or obtain the application's source code. This should be
something human-friendly. Machine-readable source-code is covered in the
'Repo' field.

==Issue Tracker==

The URL for the application's issue tracker. Optional, since not all
applications have one.

==Summary==

A brief summary of what the application is.

==Description==

A full description of the application. This can span multiple lines, and is
terminated by a line containing a single '.'.

==Repo Type==

The type of repository - for automatic building from source. If this is not
specified, automatic building is disabled for this application. Possible
values are:

  git, svn

==Repo==

The repository location. Usually a git: or svn: URL.

Normally the repository is checked out once for the application, then moved
to a particular revision/commit/tag for each build version. For an SVN
repository though, this behaviour can be changed by appending a * to the
repository URL - in this case the repository is checked out once per build
version, with the subdir parameter in place of the *. This can be beneficial
when dealing with very large SVN repositories.

==Build Version==

Any number of these fields can be present, each specifying a version to
automatically build from source. The value is a comma-separated list.
For example:

    Build Version:0.12,3,651696a49be2cd7db5ce6a2fa8185e31f9a20035

The above specifies to build version 0.12, which has a version code of 3.
The third parameter specifies the tag, commit or revision number from
which to build it in the source repository.

In addition to the three, always required, parameters described above,
further parameters can be added (in name=value format) to apply further
configuration to the build. These are:

 subdir=<path>   - Specifies to build from a subdirectory of the checked out
                   source code. Normally this directory is changed to before
		   building, but there is a special case for SVN repositories
		   where the URL is specified with a * at the end. See the
		   documentation for the Repo field for more information.
 oldsdkloc=yes   - The sdk location in the repo is in an old format
 target=<target> - Specifies a particular SDK target, when the source doesn't

Another example, using extra parameters:

    Build Version:1.09.03,10903,45,subdir=Timeriffic,oldsdkloc=yes

==AntiFeatures==

This is optional - if present, it contains a comma-separated list of any of
the following values, describing an AntiFeature the application has:

  "Ads" - the application contains advertising
  "Tracking" - the application tracks and reports your activity to somewhere
  "NonFreeNet" - the application promotes a non-Free network service
  "NonFreeAdd" - the application promotes non-Free add-ons

==Disabled==

If this field is present, the application does not get put into the public
index. This allows metadata to be retained while an application is temporarily
disabled from being published. The value should be a description of why the
application is disabled.
