Basic instructions:

1. Copy config.sample.py to config.py and edit the path within accordingly
   to point to the Android tools
2. Make a repo directory and put APK files in it
3. Run update.py
4. If it reports that any metadata files are missing, you can create them
   in the metadata directory and run it again.
5. To ease creation of metadata files, run update.py with the -c option. It
   will create 'skeleton' metadata files that are missing, and you can then
   just edit them and fill in the details.
6. Then, if you've changed things, run update.py again.
7. Running update.py adds an Icons directory into the repo directory, and
   also creates the repository index (index.xml).
8. Transfer the repo directory to the appropriate http server. The script
   in upload.sh is an example of how to do this.
