Summary:A voice/sound recording tool
Description:
A voice / sound recording utility with two modes of operation:

* Session Mode - organizes recordings into sessions, and time-stamps relative to the beginning of the session, making it useful for recording your thoughts and observations during an event. If you are a choreographer or director watching a rehearsal of your work, this can help you make note of the feedback you want to share with the cast. If you are a researcher in the field or observing an experiment, this can help you record events of interest.
* Simple Mode - easy recording and playback of sound files. If you are a musician or writer, it can help you record and remember your spontaneous moments of inspiration. Also works great for shopping lists and other kinds of reminders.

Either mode allows you to review and e-mail the recordings afterward.
