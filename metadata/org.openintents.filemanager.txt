Summary:File Manager
Description:
The OpenIntents file manager allows you to browse your SD card, create directories, rename, move,
and delete files. It also acts as an extension to other applications to display "Open" and "Save"
dialogs.

Note that this is included in Cyanogenmod as a system application, so if you are running that
you will not be able to upgrade without first manually removing (as root) the existing version.
