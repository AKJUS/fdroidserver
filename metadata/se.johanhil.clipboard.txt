Summary:Copy to clipboard via the share menu
Description:
Copy to Clipboard integrates in to the Share menu, allowing you to
copy text to the clipboard instead of sharing via an
SMS/e-mail/tweet/etc.

This is useful when you want to share text to an application that does
not implement the regular "send to" functionality, such as GTalk.
