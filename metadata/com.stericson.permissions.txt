Summary:Control permissions of installed apps
Description:
Permissions allows you to somewhat control the permissions an app is requesting
on your Android device. While it is not a perfect system, it does work
(although perhaps not on all devices). You do have to reboot the device before
the changes take place.

Note that there are newer versions of this application available elsewhere, but
these are proprietary software.
