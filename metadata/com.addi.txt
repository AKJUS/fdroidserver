Summary:Matlab/Octave clone, a math system
Description:
This is a mathematic computing environment like Matlab and Octave,
but made to work on Android devices.

The goal is for 100% compliance with how Octave works including
a compatibility mode that makes the behavior more similar to Matlab
(already very similar).
