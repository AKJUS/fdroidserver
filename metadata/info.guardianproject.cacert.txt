Summary:A slightly more vetted version of the Android CACert keystore
Description:
A slightly more vetted version of the Android CACert keystore

***
This application requires root, as well as a device that has the ‘grep’ command on it. (check busybox)

If the ‘save’ doesn’t work, then you will need to use ‘RootExplorer’ to make you /system partition read-write.
