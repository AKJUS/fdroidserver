<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p>The F-Droid server tools provide various scripts, tools and data that are used
to maintain the main F-Droid application repository. You can use these same
tools to create your own additional or alternative repository for publishing,
or to assist in creating, testing and submitting metadata to the main
repository.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">2 System Requirements</h2>

<p><a name="index-installation-1"></a>
The system requirements for using the tools will vary depending on your
intended usage. At the very least, you'll need:

     <ul>
<li>GNU/Linux
<li>Python 2.x
<li>The Android SDK
</ul>

   <p>If you intend to build applications from source you'll also need most, if not
all, of the following:

     <ul>
<li>All available SDK platforms and tools installed in the Android SDK, but *not*
the proprietary components. 
<li>The Android NDK
<li>Ant
<li>Ant Contrib Tasks (Debian package ant-contrib)
<li>Maven (Debian package maven2)
<li>JavaCC (Debian package javacc)
<li>JDK (Debian package openjdk-6-jdk)
<li>VCS clients: svn, git, hg, bzr
<li>A keystore for holding release keys. (Safe, secure and well backed up!) 
</ul>

   <p>If you intend to use the 'Build Server' system, for secure and clean builds
(highly recommended), you will also need:

     <ul>
<li>VirtualBox (debian package virtualbox-ose)
<li>Ruby
<li>Vagrant and Vagrant-snap
<li>Paramiko (debian package python-paramiko)
</ul>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Setup</h2>

<p><a name="index-setup_002c-installation-2"></a>
Because the tools and data will always change rapidly, you will almost
certainly want to work from a git clone of the tools, which are designed to
work in this way, with all associated data in a pre-defined directory
structure below the main one. To get started:

<pre class="example">     git clone git://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver.git
     cd fdroidserver
</pre>
   <p>You will now be in the root directory of the tools. All the tasks associated
with managing the repository and data are done from here.

   <p>Regardless of the intended usage of the tools, you will always need to set
up some basic configuration details. This is done by creating a file called
<code>config.py</code> which you should do by copying from <code>config.sample.py</code>
and then editing according to the instructions within.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Simple Binary Repository</h2>

<p><a name="index-binary-3"></a>
If you want to maintain a simple repository hosting only binary APKs obtained
and compiled elsewhere, the process is quite simple:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Make a repo directory and put APK files in it. 
<li>Run <code>update.py</code>. 
<li>If it reports that any metadata files are missing, you can create them
in the <code>metadata</code> directory and run it again. 
<li>To ease creation of metadata files, run <code>update.py</code> with the <code>-c</code>
option. It will create 'skeleton' metadata files that are missing, and you can
then just edit them and fill in the details. 
<li>Then, if you've changed things, run <code>update.py</code> again. 
<li>Running <code>update.py</code> adds an Icons directory into the repo directory, and
also creates the repository index (index.xml, and also index.jar if you've
configured the system to use a signed index).
        </ol>

   <p>Following the above process will result in a <code>repo</code> directory, which you
simply need to push to any HTTP (or preferably HTTPS) server to make it
accessible.

   <p>While some information about the applications (and versions thereof) is
retrieved directly from the APK files, most comes from the corresponding file
in the <code>metadata</code> directory. The metadata file covering ALL versions of a
particular application is named <code>package.id.txt</code> where package.id is the
unique identifier for that package.

   <p>See the Metadata chapter for details of what goes in the metadata file. All
fields are relevant for binary APKs, EXCEPT for 'Build Version' entries, which
should be omitted.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Building Applications</h2>

<p>Instead of (or as well as) including binary APKs from external sources in a
repository, you can build them directly from the source code.

   <p>Using this method, it is is possible to verify that the application builds
correctly, corresponds to the source code, and contains only free software. 
Unforunately, in the Android world, it seems to be very common for an
application supplied as a binary APK to present itself as Free Software
when in fact some or all of the following are true:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The source code (either for a particular version, or even all versions!) is
unavailable or incomplete. 
<li>The source code is not capable of producing the actual binary supplied. 
<li>The 'source code' contains binary files of unknown origin, or with proprietary
licenses.
        </ol>

   <p>For this reason, source-built applications are the preferred method for the
main F-Droid repository, although occasionally for technical or historical
reasons, exceptions are made to this policy.

   <p>When building applications from source, it should be noted that you will be
signing them (all APK files must be signed to be installable on Android) with
your own key. When an application is already installed on a device, it is not
possible to upgrade it in place to a new version signed with a different key
without first uninstalling the original. This may present an inconvenience to
users, as the process of uninstalling loses any data associated with the
previous installation.

   <p>The process for managing a repository for built-from-source applications is
very similar to that described in the Simple Binary Repository chapter,
except now you need to:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Include Build Version entries in the metadata files. 
<li>Run build.py to build any applications that are not already built. 
<li>Run publish.py to finalise packaging and sign any APKs that have been built.
        </ol>

   <p>To build a single version of a single application, you could run the
following:

<pre class="example">     ./build.py -p org.fdroid.fdroid -c 16
</pre>
   <p>This attempts to build version code 16 (which is version 0.25) of the F-Droid
client. If the build was succesful, two files will have been placed in the
<code>unsigned</code> directory:

<pre class="example">     org.fdroid.fdroid_16.apk
     org.fdroid.fdroid_16_src.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p>The first is the (unsigned) APK. You could sign this with a debug key and push
it direct to your device or an emulator for testing. The second is a source
tarball containing exactly the source that was used to generate the binary.

   <p>If you were intending to publish these files, you could then run:

<pre class="example">     ./publish.py
</pre>
   <p>The source tarball would move to the <code>repo</code> directory (which is the
directory you would push to your web server). A signed and zip-aligned version
of the APK would also appear there, and both files would be removed from the
<code>unsigned</code> directory.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Metadata</h2>

<p><a name="index-metadata-4"></a>
Information used by update.py to compile the public index comes from two
sources, 1) the APK files in the repo directory, and 2) the metadata files
in the metadata directory.

   <p>The metadata files are simple, easy to edit text files, always named as the
application's package ID with '.txt' appended. The following sections describe
the fields recognised within the file.

<p><a name="index-Repo-Type-13"></a>
The type of repository - for automatic building from source. If this is not
specified, automatic building is disabled for this application. Possible
values are:

     <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">git</span></samp>&rsquo;
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">svn</span></samp>&rsquo;
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">git-svn</span></samp>&rsquo;

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Metadata">Metadata</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">6.10 Repo</h3>

<p><a name="index-Repo-14"></a>
The repository location. Usually a git: or svn: URL, for example.

   <p>The git-svn option connects to an SVN repository, and you specify the URL in
exactly the same way, but git is used as a back-end. This is preferable for
performance reasons, and also because a local copy of the entire history is
available in case the upstream repository disappears. (It happens!)

   <p>For a Subversion repo that requires authentication, you can precede the repo
URL with username:password and those parameters will be passed as <samp><span class="option">--username</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">--password</span></samp> to the SVN checkout command. (This works only for
plain svn and not for git-svn - one of the very few cases where using svn is
advisable).

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Metadata">Metadata</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">6.11 Build Version</h3>

<p><a name="index-Build-Version-15"></a>
Any number of these fields can be present, each specifying a version to
automatically build from source. The value is a comma-separated list. 
For example:

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Build Version:0.12,3,651696a49be2cd7db5ce6a2fa8185e31f9a20035</span></samp>&rsquo;

   <p>The above specifies to build version 0.12, which has a version code of 3. 
The third parameter specifies the tag, commit or revision number from
which to build it in the source repository.

   <p>If the commit version starts with a !, that version is not built. Instead,
everything after the ! is used as a reason why it can't be built. The
purpose of this feature is to allow non-buildable releases (e.g. the source
is not published) to be flagged, so the scripts don't generate repeated
messages about them. (And also to record the information for review later).

   <p>In addition to the three, always required, parameters described above,
further parameters can be added (in name=value format) to apply further
configuration to the build. These are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>subdir=&lt;path&gt;</code><dd>Specifies to build from a subdirectory of the checked out source code. 
Normally this directory is changed to before building,

     <br><dt><code>bindir=&lt;path&gt;</code><dd>Normally the build output (apk) is expected to be in the bin
subdirectory below the ant build files. If the project is configured
to put it elsewhere, that can be specified here, relative to the base
of the checked out repo.

     <br><dt><code>oldsdkloc=yes</code><dd>The sdk location in the repo is in an old format, or the build.xml is
expecting such. The 'new' format is sdk.dir while the VERY OLD format
is sdk-location. Typically, if you get a message along the lines of:
"com.android.ant.SetupTask cannot be found" when trying to build, then
try enabling this option.

     <br><dt><code>target=&lt;target&gt;</code><dd>Specifies a particular SDK target, when the source doesn't. This is
likely to cause the whole build.xml to be rewritten, which is fine if
it's a 'standard' android file or doesn't already exist, but not a
good idea if it's heavily customised.

     <br><dt><code>rm=&lt;relpath&gt;</code><dd>Specifies the relative path of file to delete before the build is
done. The path is relative to the base of the build directory - i.e. 
the directory that contains AndroidManifest.xml.

     <br><dt><code>antcommand=xxx</code><dd>Specify an alternate ant command (target) instead of the default
'release'.

     <br><dt><code>forceversion=yes</code><dd>If specified, the package version in AndroidManifest.xml is replaced
with the version name for the build as specified in the metadata.

     <p>This is useful for cases when upstream repo failed to update it for
specific tag, or to build an arbitrary revision.

     <br><dt><code>forcevercode=yes</code><dd>If specified, the package version code in the AndroidManifest.xml is
replaced with the version code for the build. See also forceversion.

     <br><dt><code>update=xxx</code><dd>By default, 'android update project' is used to generate or update the
build.xml file. Specifying update=no bypasses that.

     <p>Specifiying update=force forces rebuilding of the build.xml file at the
same time - this is frequently needed with r14 of the Android platform
tools.

     <p>Be aware of any customisations in build.xml when using update=force.

     <br><dt><code>initfun=yes</code><dd>Enables a selection of mad hacks to make com.funambol.android build. 
Probably not useful for any other application.

     <br><dt><code>buildjni=yes</code><dd>Enables building of native code via the ndk-build script before doing
the main ant build.

     <br><dt><code>submodules=yes</code><dd>Use if the project (git only) has submodules - causes git submodule
init and update to be executed after the source is cloned.

     <br><dt><code>encoding=xxxx</code><dd>Adds a java.encoding property to local.properties with the given
value. Generally the value will be 'utf-8'. This is picked up by the
SDK's ant rules, and forces the Java compiler to interpret source
files with this encoding. If you receive warnings during the compile
about character encodings, you probably need this.

     <br><dt><code>prebuild=xxxx</code><dd>Specifies a shell command (or commands - chain with &amp;&amp;) to run before
the build takes place. Backslash can be used as an escape character to
insert literal commas, or as the last character on a line to join that
line with the next. It has no special meaning in other contexts; in
particular, literal backslashes should not be escaped.

     <br><dt><code>init=xxxx</code><dd>As for 'prebuild', but runs on the source code BEFORE any other processing
takes place.

     <br><dt><code>novcheck=yes</code><dd>Don't check that the version name and code in the resulting apk are
correct by looking at the build output - assume the metadata is
correct. This takes away a useful level of sanity checking, and should
only be used if the values can't be extracted.

     <br><dt><code>fixtrans=yes</code><dd>Modifies any instances of string resources that use multiple
formatting arguments, but don't use positional notation. For example,
"Hello %s, %d" becomes "Hello %1$s, %2$d". Newer versions of the
Android platform tools enforce this sensible standard. If you get
error messages relating to that, you need to enable this.

     <br><dt><code>fixapos=yes</code><dd>Like fixtrans, but deals with an even older issue relating to
'unescaped apostrophes' in translation strings.

     <br><dt><code>maven=yes</code><dd>Build with maven instead of ant

     <br><dt><code>patch=x</code><dd>Apply patch(es). 'x' names one (or more - comma-seperated)
files within a directory below the metadata, with the same
name as the metadata file but without the extension. Each of
these patches is applied to the code in turn.

     <br><dt><code>extlibs=a;b;c</code><dd>Specifies a list of external libraries (jar files) from the
<code>build/extlib</code> library, which will be placed in the <code>libs</code> directory
of the project. Separate items with semicolons.

     <br><dt><code>srclibs=a@r;b@r1;</code><dd>Specifies a list of source libraries (kept up to date using version control)
from a predefined set. Separate items with semicolons, and each item is of
the form name@rev where name is the predefined source library name and rev is
the revision in source control to use. You can then also use $$name$$ in the
prebuild command to substitute the relative path to the library directory.

     <p>The available source libraries are current hard-coded in common.py. This will
later be data-driven.

   <p>Another example, using extra parameters:

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Build Version:1.09.03,10903,45,subdir=Timeriffic,oldsdkloc=yes</span></samp>&rsquo;

</div>

<h3 class="section">6.12 AntiFeatures</h3>

<p><a name="index-AntiFeatures-16"></a>
This is optional - if present, it contains a comma-separated list of any of
the following values, describing an AntiFeature the application has:

     <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ads</span></samp>&rsquo; - the application contains advertising.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tracking</span></samp>&rsquo; - the application tracks and reports your activity to
somewhere without your consent.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NonFreeNet</span></samp>&rsquo; - the application promotes a non-Free network service.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NonFreeAdd</span></samp>&rsquo; - the application promotes non-Free add-ons.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NonFreeDep</span></samp>&rsquo; - the application depends on a non-Free application (e.g. 
Google Maps) - i.e. it requires it to be installed on the device, but does not
include it.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License</h2>

<!-- The GNU Free Documentation License. -->
<div align="center">Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</div>

<!-- This file is intended to be included within another document, -->
<!-- hence no sectioning command or @node. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
